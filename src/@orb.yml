  Allows jobs to be queued to run sequentially. Unlike eddieqebb/queue, which only prevents
  parallel execution but doesn't guarantee order. For blocking on entire workflows, try
  promiseofcake/workflow-queue. 

  This is ideal for jobs that must run in the order they are created, e.g. deployments on 
  a linear source control history.
  
  This orb requires the project to have a CircleCI PAT in order to query build states.
